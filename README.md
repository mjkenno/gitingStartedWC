## Hey, lets play 2 truths 1 lie

#let's go


what now?

Trying to figure that out haha!

does everyone know how to play 2 truths 1 lie?

Is this all we're going to be doing today :o

<!-- it might seem simple but there's a lot to it -->




2 truths 1 lie Charlie 
1 I like pineapples /L/ lie <!-- guess lie -->
2 I like coffee /L/ truth
3 I am allergic to dust /L/ lie


This seems like it could get messy very easily -_-
<!-- very true -->
